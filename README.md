Crystal: A Website Archiver
===========================

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davidfstr/Crystal-Web-Archiver/main/README/logo.png" alt="Crystal Website Archiver icon" align="right" />

Crystal is a tool that downloads high-fidelity copies of websites for long-term archival.

It works best on traditional websites made of distinct pages using 
limited JavaScript (such as blogs, wikis, and other static websites)
although it can also download more dynamic sites which have infinitely 
scrolling feeds of content (such as social media sites).

To get started downloading your first website with Crystal, please see the 
[Tutorial](#tutorial) below.

Download ‚¨áÔ∏é
--------

Either install a binary version of Crystal:

* [macOS 13 and later](https://github.com/davidfstr/Crystal-Web-Archiver/releases/download/v2.0.0/crystal-mac-2.0.0.dmg)
* [Windows 11 and later](https://github.com/davidfstr/Crystal-Web-Archiver/releases/download/v2.0.0/crystal-win-2.0.0.exe)

Or install from source, using pipx:

* Install [Python] >=3.11 and pip:
    * Ubuntu/Kubuntu 22.04+: `apt-get update; apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip python3-venv`
    * Fedora 37+: `yum update -y; yum install -y python3 python3-pip`
* On Linux, install dependencies of wxPython from your package manager:
    * Ubuntu/Kubuntu 22.04+: `apt-get install -y libgtk-3-dev`
    * Fedora 37+: `yum install -y wxGTK-devel gcc gcc-c++ which python3-devel`
* Install pipx
    * `python3 -m pip install pipx`
* Install Crystal with pipx
    * `pipx install crystal-web`
    * ‚è≥ On Linux the above step will take a long time (10+ minutes)
      because wxPython, a dependency of Crystal, will need to be built
      from source, since it does not offer precompiled wheels for Linux.
* On Linux, install a shortcut to Crystal inside GNOME/KDE applications and on the desktop:
    * `crystal --install-to-desktop`
* Run Crystal:
    * `crystal`

### Download a simple website

> A **simple website** is created or administered by only a single person, 
> may contain text and images but not video, 
> and does not requiring logging in to view its content.
> 
> There are many simple websites you can practice downloading at <https://daarchive.net/>.

Steps to download [xkcd], a simple site:

* Download Crystal. See the [Download](#download) section above for specific instructions.
* Open Crystal and press "New Project" to create a new untitled project.
* Click the big "New Root URL..." button and type in 
  "xkcd.daarchive.net" for the URL. 
  Optionally type in "Home" for the Name.
* Tick the "Create Group to Download Entire Site" checkbox.
  The "Download Site Immediately" checkbox should already be ticked.
  Press the "New" button to create the root URL, create the group for the site,
  and start downloading the site.
* The newly created "Home" URL at path "/" should already be selected.
  Click the "View" button to open the downloaded home page in your default
  web browser.
* Within the web browser you should be able to navigate to any page in the
  downloaded site.
* Return to the Crystal app. Close the untitled window.
  Don't worry if download tasks are still running because Crystal
  will offer to resume any downloads later when the project is reopened.
* You'll be prompted to save the project somewhere permanent.
  Save it as "Simple Tutorial" on your desktop.
* Find the saved "Simple Tutorial" project on your desktop and double-click it
  to open it.
* On macOS the project will open in Crystal immediately.
  On Windows or Linux a window will appear with an "OPEN ME" file.
  Double-click the "OPEN ME" file to open the project in Crystal.
* The home URL should be selected. Press "View" to see the downloaded
  home page again in your web browser.
* Congratulations! You've downloaded your first simple website with Crystal!

### Download a complex website

> Any website that is not simple is a **complex website**. In particular:
> 
> * Sites that contain content from *multiple people* are complex. 
>   Most forums, wikis (like: Wikipedia), and social media sites
>   (like: Facebook, YouTube, or X) are complex.
> * Sites that contain large assets such as video (ex: YouTube), 
>   files (ex: Hugging Face), or large images are complex.
> * Sites that require *login* to view content like paid blogs (ex: Pragmatic Engineer), 
>   paid news sites (ex: The New York Times), 
>   and paid video sites (ex: Barre3) are complex.

When downloading a complex website you need to precisely define which pages you want to download because downloading the entire site would take too much space/time.

Each complex website is different. Here is an example of downloading only
Guido's blog posts from [Artima Weblogs], a complex site containing content from
multiple people:

* Download Crystal. See the [Download](#download) section above for specific instructions.
* Open Crystal and press "New Project" to create a new untitled project.
* Click the big "New Root URL..." button and type in 
  "artima.daarchive.net" for the URL. 
  Optionally type in "Home" for the name.
* The "Download URL Immediately" checkbox should already be ticked.
  Press the "New" button to create the root URL and start downloading it.
* The newly created "Home" URL at path "/" should already be selected.
  Click the "View" button to open the downloaded home page in your default
  web browser.
* In the left navigation where it says "Artima Blogger", look for the link
  "Guido van van Rossum" [sic]. Click it.
* A Crystal error page appears that says "Page Not in Archive", because
  the link you clicked (https://artima.daarchive.net/index.html$/blogger=guido.html)
  hasn't been downloaded yet.
* Click the "Download" button to individually download and view Guido's first post list page.
* Notice at the top of the page there are links to pages 2, 3, 4, and 5
  of Guido's post list. Click the page 2 link.
* Again, a Crystal page saying "Page Not in Archive" appears.
  This time though, we want to download all similar pages.
  Tick the "Create Group for Similar Pages" checkbox at the bottom of the page
  to reveal a form for creating a group.
    * A **group** describes a collection of pages that all have the same URL pattern.
    * Crystal automatically populates its best guess for a URL Pattern.
      For this example that guessed pattern is:
      `https://artima.daarchive.net/index.html$/blogger=guido&start=#&thRange=15.html`.
      The "#" wildcard in the pattern will match any number of digits, like "15" or "30".
      There are other wildcards like "*" which will match any block of text without a "/".
    * Notice that the Preview Members box displays all URLs matching the
      currently typed URL Pattern.
    * Crystal also automatically populates its best guess for what the source of
      the Group should be.
        * The **source** of a group links to all or most members of the group.
          When Crystal is asked to redownload a group it will redownload the
          source first to see if the group has any new members.
* For this example Crystal has guessed an appropriate URL Pattern and Source
  for matching all of Guido's post list pages, so we don't need to change them.
* Optionally type in "Guido Post List, Page 2+" for the name of the group.
* The "Download Group Immediately" checkbox should already be ticked.
  Press the "Download" button to create the group and start downloading it.
* Return to the Crystal app. The top "Root URLs and Groups" pane displays
  each URL and Group you discovered by navigating the downloaded site.
  It should say:
  * ‚öìÔ∏è / - Home
  * ‚öìÔ∏è /index.html$/blogger=guido.html
  * üìÅ /index.html$/blogger=guido&start=#&thRange=15.html - Guido Post List, Page 2+
* Each ‚öìÔ∏è is a Root URL. Each üìÅ is a Group.
* Click the second ‚öìÔ∏è to select it.
* Click the "Edit" button.
* Type "Guido Post List, Page 1" for the name of the group.
* Click the "Save" button. Now the displayed URLs and groups should be:
  * ‚öìÔ∏è / - Home
  * ‚öìÔ∏è /index.html$/blogger=guido.html - Guido Post List, Page 1
  * üìÅ /index.html$/blogger=guido&start=#&thRange=15.html - Guido Post List, Page 2+
* Close the untitled window.
  You'll be prompted to save the project somewhere permanent.
  Save it as "Complex Tutorial" on your desktop.
* Congratulations! You've downloaded your first complex website with Crystal!

History üìñ
-------

David Foster wrote Crystal originally in 2011 because other website downloaders
he tried didn't work well for him and because he wanted to write a large
Python program, as Python was a new language for him at the time.

Every few years he revisits Crystal to add features allowing him to archive 
more sites that he cares about and to streamline the downloading process.


Design üìê
------

A few unique characteristics of Crystal:

* The Crystal project file format (`*.crystalproj`) is suitable for long-term archival:
    * Downloaded pages are stored in their original form as downloaded
      from the web including all HTTP headers.
    * Metadata is stored in a [SQLite database].

* To download pages automatically, the user must define "groups" of pages with similar
  URLs (ex: "Blog Posts", "Archive Pages") and specify rules for finding links to members
  of the group.
    * Once a group has been defined in this way, it is possible for the user to
      instruct Crystal to simply download the group. This involves finding links to all
      members of the group (possibly by downloading other groups) and then downloading
      each member of the group, in parallel.

The design is intended for the future addition of the following features:

* Intelligently updating the pages in websites that have already been downloaded.
    * This would be done by defining rules on groups that specify how often its members
      are updated. For example the set of "Archive Pages" on WordPress blogs is expected
      to change monthly. And the most recently added member of the "Archive Pages" group
      may change daily, whereas the other members are expected to never change.
    * Multiple revisions per downloaded resource are supported to allow multiple
      versions of the same resource to be tracked over time.
