## How to contribute to Crystal

**Welcome!** Crystal welcomes code contributions from the community.

**Note on Licensing:** Crystal uses a noncommercial license rather than 
a traditional open source license, but this does not prevent you from 
contributing code. Contributors retain full rights to their contributions and 
can use their contributed code in other projects under any license they choose.
See the [License FAQ](https://github.com/davidfstr/Crystal-Web-Archiver/wiki/License-FAQ) 
for more details.

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under
[Issues](https://github.com/davidfstr/Crystal-Web-Archiver/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, 
[open a new one](https://github.com/davidfstr/Crystal-Web-Archiver/issues/new) 
with the `type-bug` tag. Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, 
as much relevant information as possible. **Screenshots** are frequently 
helpful to include, especially if you annotate with arrows and text boxes 
explaining the unexpected behavior you are seeing.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution.
  Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change in a new GitHub issue with the `type-feature` tag and 
  start writing code.

* For development setup instructions, see the "Code Contributors" section 
  in the [README](README.md#code-contributors).

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question in new GitHub issue with the `type-question` tag.
  Crystal does not currently have a dedicated forum or mailing list for questions.


Crystal is a volunteer effort. We encourage you to pitch in and join
